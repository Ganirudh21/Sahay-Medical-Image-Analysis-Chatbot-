# Sahay-Medical-Image-Analysis-Chatbot-
The AI-powered chatbot assists healthcare professionals by analyzing medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans). It uses machine learning for image classification and NLP for query understanding, offering preliminary insights and diagnostic support to improve efficiency and accessibility in medical diagnostics.
The Medical Image Analysis Chatbot is an intelligent, conversational AI system designed to assist healthcare professionals by analyzing and interpreting medical images. The core idea is to combine computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to streamline early diagnostics and reduce the time spent on image-based assessments.

Key Objectives:
1)Automate preliminary diagnosis from medical imaging (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans).
2)Provide an interactive chatbot interface for doctors, radiologists, and patients to ask questions or seek clarification.
3)Improve accessibility and reduce dependency on immediate specialist availability.
4)Serve as a second opinion tool in clinical settings.

Features:
üì∑ Image Upload & Analysis: Users can upload medical images which are processed using pre-trained deep learning models.
üß† ML-Powered Insights: CNN-based models (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet) classify abnormalities and detect patterns in the image.
üí¨ Chatbot Interface: A user-friendly conversational UI allows for follow-up questions (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat does this X-ray indicate?‚Äù).
ü©∫ Medical Context Understanding: The chatbot understands domain-specific language using medical NLP techniques and curated knowledge bases.
üìä Reporting: Generates a structured, easy-to-understand report summarizing findings and suggestions for further investigation.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js (for chatbot interface)
Backend: Flask/FastAPI
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
NLP: spaCy, Transformers (BERT-based models)
Generative AI: LLM integration for contextual chat responses
Deployment: AWS/GCP, Docker

Impact:
1)Reduces diagnostic time and helps in early detection of critical conditions.
2)Supports underserved healthcare areas where radiologists are scarce.
3)Enhances doctor-patient communication by explaining results in simple language.
